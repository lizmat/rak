=head1 NAME

rak - plumbing to be able to look for stuff

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use rak;

# look for "foo" in all .txt files from current directory
for rak / foo /, :file(/ \.txt $/) -> (:key($path), :value(@found)) {
    if @found {
        say "$path:";
        say .key ~ ':' ~ .value for @found;
    }
}

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<rak> subroutine provides a mostly abstract core search (plumbing)
functionality to be used by modules such as (porcelain) C<App::Rak>.

=head1 THEORY OF OPERATION

The C<rak> subroutine basically goes through 6 steps to produce a
result.

=head3 1. Acquire sources

The first step is determining the objects that should be searched
for the specified pattern.  If an object is a C<Str>, it will be
assume that it is a path specification of a file to be searched in
some form and an C<IO::Path> object will be created for it.

Related named arguments are (in alphabetical order):

=item :dir - filter for directory basename check to include
=item :file - filter for file basename check to include
=item :files-from - file containing filenames as source
=item :paths - paths to recurse into if directory
=item :paths-from - file containing paths to recurse into
=item :recurse-symlinked-dir - recurse into symlinked directories
=item :recurse-unmatched-dir - recurse into directories not matching :dir
=item :sources - list of objects to be considered as source

The result of this step, is a (potentially lazy and hyperable)
sequence of objects.

=head3 2. Filter applicable objects

Filter down the list of sources from step 1 on any additional filesystem
related properties.  This assumes that the list of objects created are
strings of absolute paths to be checked.

=item :accessed - when was path last accessed
=item :blocks- number of filesystem blocks
=item :created - when was path created
=item :device-number - device number on which path is located
=item :filesize - size of the path in bytes
=item :gid - numeric gid of the path
=item :hard-links - number of hard-links to path on filesystem
=item :inode - inode of path on filesystem
=item :is-empty - is path empty (filesize == 0)
=item :is-executable - is path executable
=item :is-git-repo - is path top directory of a Git repository
=item :is-github-repo - is path top directory of a GitHub repository
=item :is-group-executable - is path executable by group
=item :is-group-readable - is path readable by group
=item :is-group-writable - is path writable 
=item :is-owned-by-group - is path owned by group of current user
=item :is-owned-by-user - is path owned by current user
=item :is-readable - is path readable by current user
=item :is-symbolic-link - is path a symbolic link
=item :is-world-executable - is path executable by any user
=item :is-world-readable - is path readable by any user
=item :is-world-writable - is path writable by any user
=item :is-writable - is path writable by current user
=item :meta-modified - when meta information of path was modified
=item :mode - the mode of the path
=item :modified - when path was last modified
=item :uid - numeric uid of path

The result of this step, is a (potentially lazy and hyperable)
sequence of objects.

=head3 3. Produce items to search in (apply transformers)

The second step is to create the logic for creating items to
search in from the objects in step 2.  If search is to be done
per object, then C<.slurp> is called on the object.  Otherwise
C<.lines> is called on the object.  Unless one provides their
own logic for producing items to search in.

Related named arguments are (in alphabetical order):

=item :encoding - encoding to be used when creating items
=item :find - map sequence of step 1 to item producer
=item :producer - producer of items by a given source
=item :with-line-ending - produce lines with line endings

The result of this step, is a (potentially lazy and hyperable)
sequence of objects.

=head3 4. Create logic for matching

Take the logic of the pattern C<Callable>, and create a C<Callable> to
do the actual matching with the items produced in step 3.

Related named arguments are (in alphabetical order):

=item :count-only - don't produce results, just count
=item :invert-match - invert the logic of matching
=item :quietly - absorb any warnings produced by the matcher
=item :silently - absorb any output done by the matcher
=item :stats - produce results, but also count

=head3 5. Create logic for running

Take the matcher logic of the C<Callable> of step 4 and create a runner
C<Callable> that will produce the items found and their possible context
(such as extra lines before or after).  Assuming no context, the runner
changes a return value of C<False> from the matcher into C<Empty>, a
return value of C<True> in the original line, and passes through any other
value.

Related named arguments are (in alphabetical order):

=item :after-context - number of lines to show after a match
=item :before-context - number of lines to show before a match
=item :context - number of lines to show around a match
=item :paragraph-context - lines around match until empty line
=item :passthru-context - pass on *all* lines

Matching lines are represented by C<PairMatched> objects, and lines that
have been added because of the above context arguments, are represented by
C<PairContext> objects.

=head3 6. Run the sequence(s)

The final step is to take the C<Callable> of step 5 and run that
repeatedly on the sequence of step 2, and for each item of that
sequence, run the sequence of step 5 on that.  Make sure any
phasers (C<FIRST>, C<NEXT> and C<LAST>) are called at the appropriate
time in a thread-safe manner.

Either produces a sequence in which the key is the source, and the
value is a C<Slip> of C<Pair>s where the key is the line-number and
the value is line with the match, or whatever the pattern matcher
returned.

Or, produces sequence of whatever a specified mapper returned
and/or with uniqueifying enabled.

Related named arguments are (in alphabetical order):

=item :mapper - code to map results of a single source
=item :map-all - also call mapper if a source has no matches
=item :unique - only return unique matches

=head1 EXPORTED SUBROUTINES

=head2 rak

The C<rak> subroutine takes a C<Callable> (or C<Regex>) pattern as the only
positional argument and quite a number of named arguments.  Or it takes a
C<Callable> (or C<Regex>) as the first positional argument for the pattern,
and a hash with named arguments as the second positional argument.  In the
latter case, the hash will have the arguments removed that the C<rak>
subroutine needed for its configuration and execution.

It returns either a C<Pair> (with an C<Exception> as key, and the
exception message as the value), or an C<Iterable> of C<Pair>s which
contain the source object as key (by default a C<IO::Path> object
of the file in which the pattern was found), and a C<Slip> of
key / value pairs, in which the key is the line-number where the
pattern was found, and the value is the product of the search
(which, by default, is the line in which the pattern was found).

The following named arguments can be specified (in alphabetical
order):

=head3 :accessed(&filter)

If specified, indicates the C<Callable> filter that should be used to select
acceptable paths by the B<access> time of the path.  The C<Callable> is
passed a C<Num> value of the access time (number of seconds since epoch)
and is expected to return a trueish value to have the path be considered
for further selection.

Indicate the number of lines that should also be returned B<after>
a line with a pattern match.  Defaults to B<0>.

=head3 :batch(N)

processed per thread at a time.  Defaults to whatever the system
thinks is best (which B<may> be sub-optimal).

=head3 :before-context(N)

Indicate the number of lines that should also be returned B<before>
a line with a pattern match.  Defaults to B<0>.

=head3 :blocks(&filter)

If specified, indicates the C<Callable> filter that should be used to select
acceptable paths by the B<number of blocks> used by the path on the filesystem

Indicate the number of lines that should also be returned around
a line with a pattern match.  Defaults to B<0>.

selection.

=head3 :dir(&dir-matcher)

If specified, indicates the matcher that should be used to select

for any situation where C<paths> is used to create the list of files
to check.

=head3 dont-catch

Flag.  If specified with a trueish value, will B<not> catch any error
during processing, but will throw any error again.  Defaults to C<False>,
making sure that errors B<will> be caught.

When specified with a string, indicates the name of the encoding
to be used to produce items to check (typically by calling
C<lines> or C<slurp>).  Defaults to C<utf8-c8>, the UTF-8
encoding that is permissive of encoding issues.

=head3 :file(&file-matcher)

If specified, indicates the matcher that should be used to select

Flag. If specified with a trueish value, will negate the return
value of the pattern if a C<Bool> was returned.  Defaults to
C<False>.

=head3 :is-empty

Flag.  If specified, indicates only paths that are B<owned> by the current
B<user>, are (not) acceptable for further selection.

=head3 :is-symbolic-link

Flag.  If specified, indicates only paths that are symbolic links,
are (not) acceptable for further selection.

=head3 :is-world-executable

Flag.  If specified, indicates paths, that are B<executable> by any user
or group, are (not) acceptable for further selection.

=head3 :is-world-readable

=head3 :is-writable

Flag.  If specified, indicates paths, that are B<writable> by the current
B<user>, are (not) acceptable for further selection.

=head3 :mapper(&mapper)

If specified, indicates the C<Callable> that will be called (in a
thread-safe manner) for each source, with the matches of that source.
The C<Callable> is passed the source object, and a list of matches,
if there were any matches.  If you want the C<Callable> to be called
for every source, then you must also specify C<:map-all>.

Whatever the mapper C<Callable> returns, will become the result of the
call to the C<rak> subroutine.  If you don't want any result to be
returned, you can return C<Empty> from the mapper C<Callable>.

=head3 :map-all

Flag.  If specified with a trueish value, will call the mapper logic, as
specified with C<:mapper>, even if a source has no matches.  Defaults to
C<False>: 

=head3 :meta-modified(&filter)

If specified, indicates the C<Callable> filter that should be used to select
acceptable paths by the B<modification> time of the path.  The C<Callable> is
passed a C<Num> value of the modification time (number of seconds since epoch)
and is expected to return a trueish value to have the path be considered
for further selection.

=head3 :mode(&filter)

If specified, indicates the C<Callable> filter that should be used to select
acceptable paths by the B<mode> of the path.  The C<Callable> is passed the
mode of a path and is expected to return a trueish value to have the path be
considered for further selection.  This is really for advanced types of tests:
it's probably easier to use any of the C<readable>, C<writeable> and
C<executable> filters.

=head3 :modified(&filter)

If specified, indicates the C<Callable> filter that should be used to select
acceptable paths by the B<modification> time of the path.  The C<Callable> is
passed a C<Num> value of the modification time (number of seconds since epoch)
and is expected to return a trueish value to have the path be considered
for further selection.

=head3 :paragraph-context

Flag. If specified with a trueish value, produce lines B<around>
the line with a pattern match until an empty line is encountered.

=head3 :passthru-context

Flag. If specified with a trueish value, produces B<all> lines.

=head3 :paths-from($filename)

If specified, indicates the name of the file from which a list
of paths to be used as the base of the production of filename
with a C<paths> search.

=head3 :paths(@paths)

If specified, indicates a list of paths that should be used
as the base of the production of filename with a C<paths>
search.  If there is no other sources specification (from
either the C<:files-from>, C<paths-from> or C<sources>) then
the current directory (aka ".") will be assumed.

If a single hyphen is specified as the path, then STDIN will be
assumed as the source.

=head3 :producer(&producer)

If specified, indicates a C<Callable> that will be called given
a source, and is expected to produce items to be inspected.
Defaults to a producer that calles the C<lines> method on a
given source, with the C<:encoding> and C<:with-line-ending>
arguments.

=head3 :recurse-symlinked-dir

Flag. If specified with a trueish value, will recurse into directories
that are actually symbolic links.  The default is C<False>: do B<not>
recurse into symlinked directories.

=head3 :recurse-unmatched-dir

Flag. If specified with a trueish value, will recurse into directories
that did B<not> pass the :<dir>.  No files will ever be produced from
such directories, but further recursion will be done if directories
are encountered.  The default is C<False>: do B<not> recurse into
directories that didn't match the C<:dir> specification.

=head3 :quietly

Flag. If specified with a trueish value, will absorb any warnings
that may occur when looking for the pattern.

=head3 :silently("out,err")

When specified with C<True>, will absorb any output on STDOUT
and STDERR.  Optionally can only absorb STDOUT ("out"), STDERR
("err") and both STDOUT and STDERR ("out,err").

=head3 :sources(@objects)

If specified, indicates a list of objects that should be used
as a source for the production of lines.

=head3 :stats

Flag.  If specified with a trueish value, will keep stats on number
of files and number of lines seen.  And instead of just returning
the results sequence, will then return a C<List> of the result
sequence as the first argument, and a C<Map> with statistics as the
second argument, with the same keys as with the C<:count-only> flag.

=head3 :uid(&filter)

If specified, indicates the C<Callable> filter that should be used to select
acceptable paths by the B<uid> of the path.  The C<Callable> is passed the
numeric uid of a path and is expected to return a trueish value to have the
path be considered for further selection.  See also C<owner> and C<group>
filters.

=head3 :unique

Flag.  If specified, indicates that only unique matches will be returned,
instead of the normal sequence of source => result pairs.

=head3 :with-line-ending

Flag.  If specified, indicates line endings are to be kept when producing
items to check.  Defaults to C<False>, meaning that line endings are
removed from items to check.  Only applicable with line-based checking.

=head2 PATTERN RETURN VALUES

The return value of the pattern C<Callable> is interpreted in the
following ways:

=head3 True

If the C<Bool>ean True value is returned, assume the pattern is found.
Produce the line unless C<:invert-match> was specified.

=head3 False

If the C<Bool>ean False value is returned, assume the pattern is B<not>
found.  Do B<not> produce the line unless C<:invert-match> was specified.

=head3 Empty

Always produce the line.  Even if C<:invert-match> was specified.  Shown
in stats as a C<passthru>.

=head3 any other value

Produce that value.

=head2 PHASERS

Any C<FIRST>, C<NEXT> and C<LAST> phaser that are specified in the
pattern C<Callable>, will be executed at the correct time.

=head2 MATCHING LINES vs CONTEXT LINES

The C<Pair>s that contain the search result within an object, have
an additional method mixed in: C<matched>.  This returns C<True> for
lines that matched, and C<False> for lines that have been added because
of a context specification (C<:context>, C<:before-context>, C<:after-context>
or C<paragraph-context>).

These C<Pair>s can also be recognized by their class: C<PairMatched> versus
C<PairContext>, which are also exported.
