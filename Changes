0.0.11  2022-08-22T21:08:35+02:00
    - Fix issue with :paragraph-context

0.0.10  2022-08-20T14:51:48+02:00
    - Make sure we stop trying to match if we reached number of required
      matches (rather than trying once more)
    - Add support for :sources-only

0.0.9  2022-08-19T14:17:48+02:00
    - Remove :is-git-repo and :is-github-repo arguments: they would
      never fire as the checks are only applied to files, and those
      are directory level checks.
    - Recognize &defined to be used as a "noop" producer of matches,
      to allow e.g. a bare :find without pattern to produce all files.
    - The return result is now always a Rak object

0.0.8  2022-08-17T23:52:03+02:00
    - Changed return value of rak to always be a Pair, with
      either an Exception / Map with stats as key, and a potentially
      empty Iterable as value
    - Change :count-only to :stats-only
    - Make sure explicit producer get an IO::Path instead of a string
    - Add ":omit-item-numbers" to get faster/leaner data-structures
      if item numbers are not needed
    - Made sure that source is always an IO::Path object, unless the
      sources were specified with :sources, or reading from STDIN

0.0.7  2022-08-17T13:25:56+02:00
    - Split :producer into :produce-one and :produce-many
    - Add support for :max-matches-per-source
    - Fixed thread-safety issue with generation of context items
    - Only use "lines" in docs if really about lines of text, else
      use the more generic "items" mnemonic.

0.0.6  2022-08-16T22:14:26+02:00
    - Rename :recurse-symlink to :recurse-symlinked-dir for clarity
    - Rename :with-line-endings to :with-line-ending for consistency
    - Add support for :recurse-unmatched-dir 
    - Add warning when reading from STDIN and there's a human attached
    - Prefixed all boolean path filters with "is-" for clarity
    - Removed :per-file and :per-line, we only need a :producer semantics
