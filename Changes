{{$NEXT}}

0.0.15  2022-08-27T12:21:06+02:00
    - Clarification about the relation between PairContext and
      PairMatched
    - Attempt to upload to fez again, as it appeared to have eaten the
      previous release

0.0.14  2022-08-27T00:15:28+02:00
    - Make PairMatched a subclass of PairContext, so that we can check
      on the PairContext type to see if it is a "normal" line number /
      line | produced value case
    - Changed name of :omit-item-numbers to :omit-item-number for
      consistency
    - Changed name of :passthru-context to :passthru, as it will
      *always* pass through all lines, even if there is no match.
      So there's not really a concept of context at work here
    - Add support for :passthru-context, which will only produce
      all items *if* there is at least one match
    - Add support for :is-owner-readable
    - Add support for :is-owner-writable
    - Add support for :is-owner-executable

0.0.13  2022-08-23T22:58:57+02:00
    - Add support for :under-version-control
    - Change semantics of matcher returning Empty: now means no match
    - Fix :invert-match logic

0.0.12  2022-08-23T13:00:04+02:00
    - Make matcher returning Nil act the same as False.  This can
      typically happen in a pattern with a try and an execution error
    - Add support for :frequencies

0.0.11  2022-08-22T21:08:35+02:00
    - Fix issue with :paragraph-context

0.0.10  2022-08-20T14:51:48+02:00
    - Make sure we stop trying to match if we reached number of required
      matches (rather than trying once more)
    - Add support for :sources-only

0.0.9  2022-08-19T14:17:48+02:00
    - Remove :is-git-repo and :is-github-repo arguments: they would
      never fire as the checks are only applied to files, and those
      are directory level checks.
    - Recognize &defined to be used as a "noop" producer of matches,
      to allow e.g. a bare :find without pattern to produce all files.
    - The return result is now always a Rak object

0.0.8  2022-08-17T23:52:03+02:00
    - Changed return value of rak to always be a Pair, with
      either an Exception / Map with stats as key, and a potentially
      empty Iterable as value
    - Change :count-only to :stats-only
    - Make sure explicit producer get an IO::Path instead of a string
    - Add ":omit-item-numbers" to get faster/leaner data-structures
      if item numbers are not needed
    - Made sure that source is always an IO::Path object, unless the
      sources were specified with :sources, or reading from STDIN

0.0.7  2022-08-17T13:25:56+02:00
    - Split :producer into :produce-one and :produce-many
    - Add support for :max-matches-per-source
    - Fixed thread-safety issue with generation of context items
    - Only use "lines" in docs if really about lines of text, else
      use the more generic "items" mnemonic.

0.0.6  2022-08-16T22:14:26+02:00
    - Rename :recurse-symlink to :recurse-symlinked-dir for clarity
    - Rename :with-line-endings to :with-line-ending for consistency
    - Add support for :recurse-unmatched-dir 
    - Add warning when reading from STDIN and there's a human attached
    - Prefixed all boolean path filters with "is-" for clarity
    - Removed :per-file and :per-line, we only need a :producer semantics

0.0.5  2022-08-16T11:03:40+02:00
    - Add support for :with-line-endings

0.0.4  2022-08-15T22:30:44+02:00
    - Add support for :count-only
    - Fix issue with laziness of match list of a source

0.0.3  2022-08-15T10:55:39+02:00
    - Add support for :git-repo and :github-repo path selection options
    - Actually make :group-readable work correctly

0.0.2  2022-08-14T16:53:38+02:00

      'recurse-symlink' flag.

      - many file property filters
      - support for mapping functionality
      - abstract sources
      - generic "per-file" logic
